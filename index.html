  <h1>The basics of the web and HTML</h1>

<b>Part 1:</b>

        <p>In part 1 you will develop enough <em>technological empathy</em> 
        to understand what happens when you open (or create) a web page. 
        Specifically, you'll gain:
        </p>

        <p>Basic understanding of how the internet works.</p>
        <p>Understanding of how <b>users, computers, servers, http,</b> 
        and <b>the internet</b> all fit together.</
<br>
<br>  
<br>  
<br>
<b>Part 2:</b>

        <p>In part 2 you will use <b>HTML tags</b> to create a simple 
        <b>HTML document</b> that a browser can display as a web page.</p>

        <br>
        <br>

<b>Unit 1:</b>        
    <p>The basics of the Web.<br>
      <br>
      1)The  Web- Collections of HTML documents.<br>
    2) HTML- <em>HyperText-Markup-Language.</em><br>
      HTML is made up of:<br>
          -text content- what you see<br>
          -mark up- what it looks like<br>
          -references to other documents- e.g. images and videos<br>
          -links to other pages<br>
    3) URLs<br>
      4) HTTP- protocol your web browser uses to communicate with 
      servers.<br>
      5) Web applications
    </p>

<b>Five take aways from the lesson</b>

<p><b>1- What a Web Page is</b><br>
  <br>
  A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. 
  Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.
</p>

<b>2 - How Coding Works</b>

<p>Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a 
computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions 
the programmer wrote</p>

<b>3 - Computers are Stupid</b>

<p>Programmers need to write <em>exactly</em> the way a computer 
understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax"). </p>

<b>4 - Programmers Can't Remember Everything</b>

<p>There are too many details to keep everything in your head. 
And that's okay. If you forget how to make text italic in HTML, you 
can always just look it up.</p>

<b>5 - Basic HTML Vocabulary</b>

<p>You will be using HTML in the next few lessons, so it will be helpful
if you're comfortable with the jargon.</p>

<p><b>-Tag:</b> An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. 
Most tags have an opening tag and a closing tag. Some tags (called 
"void" tags) do not require a closing tag. </p>

<p><b>-Element:</b> An HTML element refers to everything within a set 
of opening and closing tags.</p>
